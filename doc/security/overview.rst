Security System Overview
========================

The Shuup password security system provides comprehensive protection against weak passwords and unauthorized access through a multi-layered approach.

Architecture Components
-----------------------

Password Validation Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Prevent weak passwords from being created

**Components**:

- Django's built-in password validators
- Custom ``StrongPasswordValidator`` with regex requirements
- Integration with registration and password change forms

**Key Features**:

- Minimum length enforcement (8+ characters)
- Character complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Username/email similarity detection
- Common password prevention

Weak Password Detection Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Identify existing users with potentially weak passwords

**Components**:

- Heuristic analysis utilities (``shuup.core.utils.weak_password_detection``)
- Pattern matching against common weak passwords
- User attribute analysis (username, email, names)

**Detection Methods**:

- Static pattern matching against known weak passwords
- User attribute correlation (password likely matches username/email)
- Runtime password analysis during authentication

Authentication & Middleware Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Intercept and remediate weak password access

**Components**:

- ``WeakPasswordDetectionBackend``: Detects weak passwords during login
- ``WeakPasswordInterceptMiddleware``: Blocks access until password is updated
- Session management and security bypass prevention

**Security Features**:

- Session clearing to prevent bypasses
- Forced password reset workflows
- Admin and customer user handling

Administrative Interface Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Provide tools for security management and monitoring

**Components**:

- Security Dashboard with metrics and trends
- Weak Password User Management interface
- Bulk action capabilities
- Configuration management

**Management Features**:

- Real-time security metrics
- User risk assessment
- Bulk notification and remediation tools
- Security audit logging

Communication Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Notify users about security requirements

**Components**:

- Email template system (HTML and text versions)
- Multiple notification types (alerts, resets, breach notifications)
- Careful language about heuristic analysis

**Email Types**:

- Weak password notifications
- Password reset emails
- Security breach alerts
- Security policy reminders

Security Workflow
-----------------

New User Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. User submits registration form
2. Password validation runs against all configured validators
3. Strong passwords are accepted, weak passwords are rejected with specific feedback
4. User account is created with validated password

Existing User Login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. User attempts login with credentials
2. Authentication backend validates credentials
3. If password is weak (detected during login), user is flagged
4. Middleware intercepts subsequent requests
5. User is redirected to forced password reset
6. Sessions are cleared to prevent bypasses

Administrative Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Administrators access security dashboard
2. System displays real-time metrics and trends
3. Weak password users are identified and listed
4. Bulk actions can be performed (notifications, resets, etc.)
5. Security policies can be configured

Heuristic Analysis Approach
---------------------------

The system uses heuristic analysis to identify potentially weak passwords without storing or accessing actual passwords:

Pattern Matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Compares user attributes (username, email, names) against known weak password patterns
- Identifies users whose attributes match common weak passwords
- Examples: user "admin" likely has password "admin", user "test@example.com" likely has password "test"

Risk Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Calculates risk scores based on pattern matches
- Prioritizes administrator accounts for higher security
- Considers account activity and last login patterns

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Cannot detect all weak passwords (only those matching patterns)
- May produce false positives for users with secure passwords
- Requires careful communication to users about "likely matches"

Integration Points
------------------

Django Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Seamlessly integrates with Django's authentication system
- Uses Django's password validation framework
- Follows Django admin patterns and conventions

Shuup Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Integrates with Shuup's admin module system
- Uses Shuup's user management and email systems
- Follows Shuup's UI/UX patterns

Email System Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Uses Django's email framework
- Supports multiple email backends
- Includes comprehensive email template system

Security Considerations
-----------------------

Privacy Protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Never stores or logs actual passwords
- Uses heuristic analysis to minimize privacy impact
- Careful language in communications about analysis methods

False Positive Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Provides clear opt-out mechanisms for false positives
- Includes human review processes for bulk actions
- Maintains audit logs for security decisions

Scalability
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Caches security metrics to reduce database load
- Provides bulk operation capabilities
- Supports gradual rollout strategies

Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~

- Follows industry best practices for password security
- Provides audit trails for compliance reporting
- Supports regulatory requirements for security notifications
